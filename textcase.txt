Testing Primitive Root Check:

Test Case 1: A is a primitive root of q.

a = 2
q = 5

Test Case 2: A is not a primitive root of q.

a = 3
q = 7

Testing Public Key and Shared Key Computation:

Test Case 3: Compute public key and shared key with valid inputs.

a = 2
q = 11
Xa = 3
Xb = 5

Test Case 4: Invalid private key (Xa or Xb greater than q).

a = 5
q = 13
Xa = 15
Xb = 8
