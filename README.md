# CryptoKeyExchange

CryptoKeyExchange is a Python program that provides a robust solution for secure key exchange and communication. This versatile tool enables users to enhance the security of their communication by checking primitive roots, computing and exchanging public keys, and detecting and preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Features

- **Primitive Root Checker:** Verify the existence of primitive roots in a given modulus to ensure the security of key exchange.

- **Public Key and Session Key Generation:** Compute and exchange public keys and session keys with nonces to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** Implementation of a man-in-the-middle attack to test out the detection function.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CryptoKeyExchange.git
   cd CryptoKeyExchange

   Run the program:

bash
---------
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen menu to choose your desired functionality (e.g., primitive root check, public key/session key exchange).

Enjoy secure key exchange and communication!
